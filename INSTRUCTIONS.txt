  QUESTIONS?

     For questions or to report errors, you may email the programmer directly at:

             randall.green@wright.edu

     For errors, please include your parameter file you are using and any data files it 
     produced. You must put them in a folder and zip it before sending. On a Mac, sending 
     files without ziping WILL corrupt the files and make them unreadable to the LDS Program.

 
  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

     This program was written in the JAVA programming language. It will run on
     Windows or Macintosh computers. You need a three-button mouse for the focus task.  


  PARAMETER FILES:

     The variable values for the experiment are not included in this program. They are read 
     in from a parameter file instead. This way the experimenter can alter the way it works
     without the need of a programmer.
     Open the LDS folder. Open the folder named EXPERIMENT and then open the folder 
     named PARAMETERS. In it is all of your parameter files. You can edit or create these
     using a plain text editor such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Macs.

     Because this is a plain text file, it is important to keep out non-printing characters
     that can confuse the program. To do this, do not leave blank lines. Put a '/' on the
     line and the program will ignore it and any other text after it. Use a comma at the
     end of lines to prevent non-printing characters there.

     The first line will set the program into DEBUG_MODE if set to TRUE. This will cause
     printout of variables on the screen. If you don't want to debug, set it to FALSE.

     There are 3 types of tasks you can perform. The first one is the TEXT_TASK, useful for
     giving instructions to the subject. At the top of the file are 6 lines that affect the
     text when displayed:
 
            /for TEXT_TASKs
            TEXT_BACKGROUND_COLOR_RGB,0,0,0,  
            TEXT_COLOR_RGB,0,0,255,           
            TEXT_FONT_SIZE,25,
            TEXT_X_START,400,
            TEXT_Y_START,200,
	    TEXT_Y_SPACING,45,
            
     The background color and text color are set with 3 Red Green and Blue values which must
     be between 0 and 255. The remaining lines' values are in pixels. X is the horizontal axis
     of the screen, and Y is the vertical axis going from top to bottom, with pixel 0 at the top.

     An example of a TEXT_TASK is as follows:

            /--------------------------------------------------------------------
            BEGIN_TEXT_TASK,
            TEXT_ON_LINE,0,                                  FOCUS DEMONSTRATION
            TEXT_ON_LINE,2,CHOOSE AN IMAGE BY MOVING THE MOUSE CURSOR INSIDE OF IT.
            TEXT_ON_LINE,3,A BLUE OR YELLOW CIRCLE WILL APPEAR IN THE SELECTED IMAGE.
            TEXT_ON_LINE,4,A STREAM OF 16 DIGITS WHICH MIGHT CONTAIN A TARGET LETTER WILL
            TEXT_ON_LINE,5,BE PRESENTED IN THE CIRCLE.
            TEXT_ON_LINE,6,IF THE CIRCLE IS BLUE THE TARGET LETTER WILL BE RIGHT SIDE UP.
            TEXT_ON_LINE,7,IF THE CIRCLE IS YELLOW THE TARGET LETTER WILL BE UPSIDE DOWN.
            TEXT_ON_LINE,8,IF THE TARGET LETTER IS A P, THEN PRESS THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.
            TEXT_ON_LINE,9,IF THE TARGET LETTER IS A T, THEN PRESS THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.
            TEXT_ON_LINE,10,IF THERE IS NO TARGET LETTER THEN PRESS THE MIDDLE BUTTON.
            END_TASK,
            /--------------------------------------------------------------------

     The numeric values are the line numbers. The subject will read this text and press a 
     DONE button to continue. You may use commas inside the TEXT_ON_LINE text. No commas 
     are needed at the end of text.

     The second kind of task is the SWITCHING_TASK. This is an example:

            BEGIN_SWITCHING_TASK,SWITCHING1,
            /
            SET_NO_OF_BLOCKS,8,
            SET_NO_OF_TRIALS,75,
            SET_PROBABILITY_OF_SWITCHING,10,90,
            /
            SHOW_ACCURACY,TRUE,
            CRITERION_TO_PERCENT,75,1,
            CRITERION_TO_TRIALS,3,
            /
            END_TASK,

    The chosen file name for the data output of this example task is SWITCHING1. It will
    run 8 blocks of 75 trials each. The SET_PROBABILITY_OF_SWITCHING sets the probability
    of switching from Greater Than Less Than 5 Task to the Odd Even Task and back again.
    The first value affects IMAGE_0 and the second affects IMAGE_1 (See images in the
    IMAGES folder).

    SHOW_ACCURACY, CRITERION_TO_PERCENT and CRITERION_TO_TRIALS are optional commands. SHOW_ACCURACY
    set to true will  display accuracy to the subject after each trial. CRITERION_TO_PERCENT,75,1 will
    cause the program to go on if the final score is at or above 75 percent, or to jump back 1 task to
    the TEXT_TASK that precedes it if the score is below 75 percent. You can jump back as many tasks 
    as you wish. If the jump back number is 0, then it will repeat the same task again. If a task
    repeats, the data will be appended to the previous data file. REPETITION_NO in the data will 
    be 1 for the first time through and 2 for the second time through, etc. CRITERION_TO_TRIALS,3,
    will tell the program to end if the subject gets less than 75 percent on 3 straight trys. The
    message 'CALL EXPERIMENTER' will then be displayed. The CRITERION_TO_TRIALS command can only be
    used with the CRITERION_TO_PERCENT command. If CRITERION_TO_TRIALS is omitted, then the program
    will repeat the test until the subject gets at or above 75 percent.

    The third kind of task is the FOCUS_TASK. This is an example:
 
            BEGIN_FOCUS_TASK,FOCUS2,
            /
            SET_NO_OF_BLOCKS,8,
            SET_NO_OF_TRIALS,75,
            SET_PROBABILITY_OF_HIGH_FOCUS,10,90,
            /
            SET_TARGET_LETTERS,P,T,
            NO_OF_SYMBOLS,16,
            LETTER_NOT_IN_FIRST,5,
            LETTER_NOT_IN_LAST,2,
            SYMBOL_DISPLAY_TIME,3,
            /
            SHOW_ACCURACY,TRUE,
            CRITERION_TO_PERCENT,75,1,
            CRITERION_TO_TRIALS,3,
           /
            END_TASK,

    The chosen file name for the data output of this example task is FOCUS2. It will
    run 8 blocks of 75 trials each. The SET_PROBABILITY_OF_HIGH_FOCUS sets the probability
    of seeing an upside down character. The first value affects IMAGE_0 and the second 
    affects IMAGE_1. SET_TARGET_LETTERS,P,T, sets the 2 target letters. NO_OF_SYMBOLS,16,
    will generate a random string of 16 digits. The program makes sure that the same digit
    does not appear twice in a row. For each trial, there is a one in three chance a letter
    'P' will be present, a one third chance a 'T' will be present, and a one third chance 
    there will be no letter at all. The target letter, if used, replaces one of the digits.
    It should not appear in the first 5 positions, and it is not to appear as the last 2
    characters. The SYMBOL_DISPLAY_TIME must be multiples of the frame rate (16.6 msecs).
    The display time of each character is therefore 3 times 16.6 milliseconds (49.8 msecs).

    SHOW_ACCURACY & CRITERION_TO_PERCENT are optional commands (see description above).

    At the end of the file you must use the STOP command.


  DATA FILES:

     The data are stored in the DATA folder. The names of the data files consist of 3 parts. The first 
     is the task file name given in the parameter file. So for the line BEGIN_FOCUS_TASK,FOCUS2, then 
     FOCUS2 would be the first part of the filename. The 2nd part is the task name, either SWITCHING_TASK 
     or FOCUS_TASK. The 3rd part is the subject name taken from line 1 of the Setup Menu screen, as typed 
     by the experimenter when the program starts. So an example of a valid file name might be: 
     "SWITCHING_DEMO SWITCHING_TASK SUBJECT2". The extension for these files is '.CSV' which stands for
     Comma Seperated Variables. By using this extension, clicking on the file will cause Excel to start 
     immediately and import the file without any further questions. 

     All times are in milliseconds.
        
     ANGLE_0 and ANGLE_1 are the angles of the two images.

     In the Focus Task data:
     
        WAIT_FOR_MOUSE time is the time the mouse pointer remains unmoved.

        ENTER_CIRCLE_TIME is the time it takes from starting to move the mouse until it enters a circle.

        TIME_TO_TARGET is the time from when the digits are starting to be displayed until the time
                       the letter is displayed. There is a one third chance there will be no letter 
                       present. If so, TIME_TO_TARGET will be the time from when the digits are starting 
                       to be displayed until the time after the last digit is displayed. At this time the
                       subject should know there is no target. 

        DECISION_TIME is the time from when the target appears until the subject answers. If the subject 
                      clicks the mouse before the target appears then the time will be negative.

        TARGET_STRING is the sequence of characters that were displayed. A '!' mark is added on the end 
                      to prevent Excel from trying to represent this as a large floating point number.

        TARGET_LETTER is the letter that was imbedded in the string of digits. It will have a '*' symbol
                      if no letter was present.

        TARGET_INDEX is the position the target letter was in the TARGET_STRING. A 0 means a letter was
                     not present.

        
    In the Switching Task data:
     
        WAIT_FOR_MOUSE time is the time the mouse pointer remains unmoved.

        ENTER_CIRCLE_TIME is the time it takes from starting to move the mouse until it enters a circle.

        DECISION_TIME is the time from when the target appears until the subject answers.


  TO RUN THE PROGRAM: 

     1. Open the LDS folder and click on LDS.jar file. 
        The program should start. On a Mac, you may get the following error: 
        “LDS.jar” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer". 
        To open it, right mouse click and select open from the menu. After the first time, 
        it runs without this error.  
   
     2. The setup screen ignores mouse inputs. To select a field, use the up and
        down arrow keys. You can delete an entry by pressing the delete key.
        The first line is the data file output name. The program prevents you from overwriting
        a previos file with the same name. You can use the filename JUNK when debuging and
        it will overwrite a previous JUNK file without a warning, useful in trying out the program
        without producing a lot of data files.
        The second line is an optional data tag that appears in a column of the data. You could 
        put anything you wish here, like the experimenter's initials, the sex of the subject, ect.
        On the 3rd and 4th line are the parameter file names that control the experiment. In this 
        case, we have SWITCHING_FIRST and FOCUS_FIRST to allow counterbalancing the order of the 
        two tasks.      

     3. Press the START button next to the parameter file you wish to execute.
     
     4. When instructions appear, you may read them and press DONE button when through.
     
     5. If you wish to stop the program, hold down control key (command key on a Mac) and press Q.
        The program ignores the normal exit buttons on the window to prevent the subject from
        accidently exiting.

     Data is appended to the output file in the DATA folder after each trial.

     If you wish to see a short demo of how the program works then use the DEBUG parameter file.
     Arrow down to the third line and enter DEBUG, then press START button. In it, DEBUG_MODE
     is set to TRUE, so there will be an output of variables on the screen.


  SYSTEM FILE:

     In the EXPERIMENT folder there is a SYSTEM folder. In it is the SYTEM_SETUP file:

        SCREEN_SIZE,1300,800,
        OVERIDE_DATA_FILE,JUNK,
        OVERIDE_EXPERIMENT_PARAMETER_FILE_1,FOCUS_FIRST,
        OVERIDE_EXPERIMENT_PARAMETER_FILE_2,SWITCHING_FIRST,
        STOP,
        /

     SCREEN_SIZE sets the area of the program window. The first value should be set to the width of 
     the monitor you are using, in pixels. The second value should be set to the height of your monitor,
     in pixels. This will cover up your desktop when running and prevent the subject from seeing your
     icons on the desktop.

     The next 3 lines set the default data file name and the 2 parameter file names.

  VERSION CONTROL:

     The name of the folder is the unique version number. It is "LDS" followed by the date 
     it was compiled. The version number is important for you to track changes or errors in 
     the program. When running, the version is displayed in the upper left hand corner of the 
     window. When data is produced, the version is embedded in the last column of the data 
     header so that later you may know which program produced it. Therefore, please do not change 
     the folder name.
